# Retro-style Web Gallery

A single-page dynamic application with a mobile-first, responsive design, that allows users to post/delete images, make/delete comments, and browse other posted images. Created backend using Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize and SQLite for persistent storage of posts, images, and comments. 

# Notes
* Used Node.js for JS server environment.
* Used Express.js for routing and creating RESTful API.
* Used Sequelize as ORM for SQLite.
* Utilized async programming to provide optimal UI performance.
* Followed Model-View-Controller design pattern for code maintainability (model: SQLite database, view: HTML, CSS, controller: routers).
* Used ThunderClient to test server response to client HTTP requests.
